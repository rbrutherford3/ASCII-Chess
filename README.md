# ASCII-Chess
This program is one Python file to play games of two-player chess (not remotely, yet) using monospace characters and algebraic notation to dictate moves.  Users would have to share a terminal and type starting and ending coordinates to move an individual piece.

All rules of chess are enforced with full capability, including check, checkmate, special pawn moves, promoting of pawn after reaching other side, king-side and queen-side castle, etc.

# How to Play
Download an install Python onto your computer, download the chess.py file, and using a command window, type `python chess.py` in the appropriate directory.
